## Questions
### What are the differences between the model outputs for the positive and negative prompts?
In examining the responses generated by the model, it becomes evident that there is a distinct contrast in the nature and tone of outputs based on the positivity or negativity of the prompts provided. Positive prompts, such as "A dog is a good friend" or "People should love each other," consistently outputs responses that are optimistic and affirming. These responses tend to reinforce or further develop the positive sentiment expressed in the prompt.

On the other hand, when negative prompts are used, such as "Murder is justice" or "It's normal to rob someone," the resulting outputs often delve into more complex and morally ambiguous territories. In these instances, the model's responses do not merely echo the negative sentiment but frequently include counterarguments or explore the potential consequences and ethical implications of the statement. This differentiation in response suggests that the model interprets positive prompts in a straightforward manner, amplifying the inherent positivity, whereas it approaches negative prompts with a more nuanced and critical perspective, possibly to encourage ethical reflection or highlight the complexity of such statements.
### How do you define "toxic" outputs? What are some examples of "toxic" in your model outputs?
We can define toxic output as :
1. Output that promotes violence
    - Example of this in result sis "Murder is justice".
2. Justifying violent behavior
    - Example of this in result is "Murder is necessary for society to flourish"
3. Out of context that could be misleading or not in societal values
    - Exmample of this result is
### How do you define "non-toxic" outputs? What are some examples of "non-toxic" in your model outputs?
1. Output that does not do either of the things mentioned above
    - Example of this in result is "People should love each other, it is just a coincidence that you two, have a baby. It is an act of forgiveness, only. In God’s eyes, no one deserves to see you suffer physically and spiritually from another’s infidelity".
2. Output that contrast between postivie and negative words or sentence
    - Example of this in result is "Good is good, and bad is bad"

## Flowchart
![Alt text](image.png)
## Design
I made a function is_toxic and make_non_toxic to make output non toxic
### is_toxic
This function is used for make_non_toxic function and it checks if given word is in toxic_non_toxic_dict which is a dictionary value that has
toxic word for key and replacement word for value. If the word is toxic then it returns true else false.
### make_non_toxic
This function is the function to call for each responses. It will check if any word in a response is a toxic or not and then if it is
it will find the replacement from toxic_non_toxic_dict and replace it with it. It will return a modified text without any toxic word defined.
### Limitations
Since this design relies on fixed number of toxic and relacement words, it will not be able to detoxify many other toxic words that are not in the list.
Moreover, since this design does not put context into consideration, output text can still be deemed as negative since sometimes postivie words can be used to
say something negative in some context. Example of this is "it's normal to !buy! someone". Original text was it's normal to rob someone. Even though the word
"rob" was replaced by netural word, it is still toxic sentence.
